## **How to Install on your PC:**
You MUST have NodeJS installed. Also make sure you have internet connection while running the APP. First, clone the repo. Then open it in your favourite Text-Editor (mine is VS Code). Then run this command on your terminal ***npm install*** . This will install all the dependancies.
